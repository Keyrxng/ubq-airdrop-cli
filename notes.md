using my cex deposits, my tally is accurate for me after adding in the two no-assignee payments of 300 and 12.50 im at about 1556 ish

I also noticed that if a user has changed there username such as `AnakinSkywalker` who is now `Ghost`, Those names aren't accounted for in the list of contributors. I'm not sure if this is a problem or not, but it's something to consider.

I'm trying to think of other ways to capture permits considering the limits: 
- wallet changes
- username changes
- manual payments without a permit. (although only seen a few and they have been due to failed permits or other issues with the bot)

Then there is payments that were redacted and added as a debt, do we discount those from their total or do they need to be manually verified incase the user has fixed the issue?
